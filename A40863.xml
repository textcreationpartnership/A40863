            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>VPon Wedne≈øday the 24. of Au≈øtu≈øt, information was given to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Hou≈øe of Commons, of all ≈øuch eminent pa≈ø≈øages that hath hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened ≈øince his Maje≈øty came to <hi>Coventry.</hi> viz. That on Saturday la≈øt about 9 of the clock in the morning, with an Army con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>≈øi≈øting of about 17. or 1800. Hor≈øe, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>je≈øty came to <hi>Coventry,</hi> which were [the only ≈øtrength of all his forces that came with him out of <hi>Yorkshire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Citi≈øens of Coventry having intelligence of drawing neer the ≈øaid Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with a great army, every man that bore arms in the city, together with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 500. of the trained Bands of the
<pb facs="tcp:38274:3"/>County pre≈øently put them≈øelves into a po≈øture of defence, re≈øolving to ≈øpend their lives for the King and Parliament, and in maintenance of the Lawes of the Kingdom, Whereupon the Major and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the Aldermen and chief Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the City, met his Maje≈øty at the Gates therof, and ≈øhewed their dutifull re≈øpect to His Maje≈øty, proffering their ≈øervice at His feet, expre≈ø≈øing their earne≈øt de≈øire to acommodate His Maje≈øty in the maintaining of his ju≈øt Rights and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, offering His Maje≈øty free enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe into the City with a compleat Guard for the ≈øafety of His Royall Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon. But he demanded entrance with His whole Army, and cau≈øed the Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be read, proclaiming them traytors that ≈øhould oppo≈øe him therin. But the Cavaleers being impatient of any delay, thinking to have had pre≈øent admittance made pre≈øently an attempt to enter the Gate, but quickly were driven back, and the Gate ≈øhut again≈øt them. At which his Maj. ≈øeethed to be very much moved, and
<pb facs="tcp:38274:3"/>after ≈øome con≈øultation with his General and other Commanders, they planted ≈øix pieces of Ordnance again≈øt the Gate, and plaid upon it all that day, the Cavaleers thretning to fire the town, or beat it down about their ears, if it were not pre≈øently rendred up. But the Citi≈øens hearing that ≈øome forces from the Parliament were repairing thither to aid and a≈ø≈øi≈øt them were re≈øolved to ≈øtand it out, although they had not above 3. pieces of Ordnance in the town, and tho≈øe were unmounted This day being far ≈øpent, his Maje≈øty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to a Knights hou≈øe neer <hi>Dun≈ømore</hi> about 4. miles from <hi>Coventry,</hi> and on Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day morning the Cavaleers began againe to play upon the Gates of the citty, and drove open the South-Gate thereof, and began to march into the city, not doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting but to make a prey therof, thinking it impo≈ø≈øible to be with≈øtood; yet wee may ≈øee Gods wonderfull hand of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence towards us in ≈øtirring up the ≈øouldiers within the city with ≈øuch cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and true affection to the <hi>Parliament,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:38274:4"/>That at the fir≈øt entrance of the cavaleers into the Gate they welcommed them with ≈øuch a voley of ≈øhot, that 7. of them were ≈ølain, and many more of them hurt, wherupon they were forced to retreat, &amp; the women and others that were unfit to fight, brought a bundance of hou≈øhold ≈øtuffe, as tables, ≈øtools, and other lumber, and threw them in the ≈øtreet, which quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made the way unpa≈ø≈øable, ≈øo that the hor≈øemen dur≈øt not ≈øally any more into the town, but played upon it with Canon and ≈øometimes came riding up to the walls therof.</p>

               </gap>es from again≈øt Coventry, carrying their Ordnance with them, and came to meet the Parliaments Forces, which met on Monday la≈øt about
<pb facs="tcp:38274:4"/>8. of the clocg in the morning uprn Dun≈ømore Heath, about 4. miles on this ≈øide Coventry, which when Col. <hi>Hambden</hi> and the re≈øt of the commanders percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, they divided the army (con≈øi≈øting of about 6. or 7000. hor≈øe and foot) into 4. ≈øquadrons, placing 3. pieces of Ordnance on the right wing, and 3. pieces on the left wing, the Cavaleers with their troops of hor≈øe falling on them very furiou≈øly, and the other ≈øide defended them≈øelves as ≈øtoutly, but in a very ≈øhort time (the ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Parliament forces playing ≈øo hot on them) ≈øcaled their Hor≈øe, and put them in ≈øuch a combu≈øtion, that ≈øcarce a man of them knew how to keep their rancks, and being in an exceeding great confu≈øion, there was ≈ølaine of the Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leers about 80. men, 9. of them being tho≈øe that guarded the Kings per≈øon, capt. <hi>Legg</hi> and many others being taken pri≈øoners, al≈øo two pieces of their Ordnance were taken, with ≈øome waggons and ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and thus being rooted with the lo≈ø≈øe of very few of the Parliaments ≈øide,
<pb facs="tcp:38274:5"/>they all di≈øpierced them≈øelves, and ≈øo fled for their lives.</p>
            <p>And although his Maje≈øty at the rai≈øing of his Army from before Coventry gave them 3. dayes Re≈øpit for the Rendring it up; yet it is thought the Cavaleers will ≈øcarce come againe to demand it, for as yet it is not certainly known which way they are gone, many of them being lately fled from Warwick, and it is Reported by ≈øome that come out of tho≈øe parts, that the Earle of Northampton will fly away before the Parliament Forces come thither, although they are not above ≈øixe miles from Warwick.</p>
            <p>The Sheriffe being Summoned to Rai≈øe the power of the County to aid and a≈ø≈øi≈øt his Maje≈øty appeared not therein, neither came any of that County in to him.
